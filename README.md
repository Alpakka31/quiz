# quiz
A little quiz game written in C.  

You need the clang compiler for compiling this game. Though GCC works fine aswell.  
To compile and install this game, run `make && make install`.  
If you want to use GCC instead of clang, run `make CC=gcc && make install`.  
The program will be called 'quiz'.
